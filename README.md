kinect-shenanigans
==================

[summer 2014] ReadML curriculum development with the kinect (basically all the CV shenanigans)

####Learning the math
-we should learn/know it for fun/knowledge
-however don't overwhelm the new members who haven't taken the math classes yet to understand everything easily...
-mention some of the black boxes, and if people want to learn more, please talk to us :DDD

####Hardware setup
-please make this as painless as possible...............
-debugging and things
-maybe write a script that does the installs/setup

####Ideation! kinect in ReadML curriculum
-Learning how to OpenNI: exposure to the API (so...maybe going through some example code?), plot some raw output
-single point tracking (so, maybe a doodle app or something pretty like silk)
-people recognition - fun, easily applicable to other projects
-talking about what problems are well suited for the kinect
-segue to a fun ideation session with the ReadML members :P

####Potential projects 
-object recognition with depth sensor
-audiomotion! polishing our music therapy hack project
-simon says - pick a simon, detect when the person says "simon says" (audio?? or some other way to distinguish simon), see if the other people did the action...
-semaphore - will the kinect handle this well if it's flags when it's usually used for people?
-some photography things, not necessarily ML related: -add depth of field (photo effects) - not the most ML-y but it's good for getting familiar with the included sensor data
-replicating just dance - choreograph, tell program to give directions on how to dance, then see if the person did it correctly/had good timing
